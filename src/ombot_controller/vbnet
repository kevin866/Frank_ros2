Robot: OMBot Arm (ROS 2 Humble)
Date: 2025-11-04

Controllers:
- ResolvedRateController (RRC)
- JointImpedanceController (JIC)

RMW:
- Switched to CycloneDDS (rmw_cyclonedds_cpp) to fix Fast CDR deserialization spam.

== BEFORE ==
RRC dt ≈ 0.096 s  (~10.4 Hz)
JIC dt ≈ 0.096 s  (~10.4 Hz)
HW read: ~95.8 ms   HW write: ~0.04 ms
Behavior: stop-and-go in null mode, mid-motion stalls.

== AFTER (bulk read improvements) ==
RRC dt ≈ 0.016 s  (~62.5 Hz)
JIC dt ≈ 0.016 s  (~62.5 Hz)
HW read: ~15.9 ms   HW write: ~0.04 ms
Behavior: smooth, no mid-motion stops.

== NEXT GOAL (for 200–250 Hz) ==
Target HW read ≤ 3–4 ms:
- GroupSyncRead / Indirect addressing (one read per cycle)
- Baudrate ≥ 3 Mbps (Pro/X); USB latency_timer = 1 ms
- Read only pos/current each cycle; move diagnostics to 1–2 Hz
